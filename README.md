# PimpMy10BIS

I have discovered that 10bis has all of it's API fully open to any client, meaning no authentication is made when a request is sent - so you could use clientside javascript functions like - update order, delete order, review a restaurant, and most commonly used - order even if the time is up or the order limit is full... :)

the script i uploaded addresses only the last of what i mentioned, if you want one the the rest - you'll have to work and find it on your own... ;)
